Motivation
==========
This program was created for a very specfic problem I had. I had a large encrypted zip file that I lost/forgot the password for. Using traditional bruteforce methods resulted in a lot of false positives.

This program hopes to minimize false positives. It works by actually checking to see if a given file type exists in the 'plaintext' after attempting a guess password.
More info about Python's ZipFile lib can be found here:
https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipfile.html#zipfile.ZipFile.open

Installation Instructions
=========================
`pip install .`

If you're using PyEnv like me, then be sure to rehash before trying to run the program:
`pyenv rehash`


Usage
=====
`breakzip <zipfile_name> <known_file_extension>`

Let's say we had an encrypted zip file named `cats.zip` with a jpg file in it.
In this example the password is `fun` and our wordlist contains `fun`.

`$ breakzip cats.zip jpg < wordlist
Found it! -> fun`

We can also use a password generator like JohnTheRipper to provide passwords.

`$ ./JohnTheRipper/run/john --mask=fu?a -stdout | breakzip cats.zip jpg
Press 'q' or Ctrl-C to abort, almost any other key for status
95p 0:00:00:00 100.00% (2020-04-13 17:35) 1520p/s fu|
Found it! -> fun`
